Welcome to the **Simple Python Applications** repository! 🎉 This repository is designed for Python beginners looking to improve their programming skills through practical examples and hands-on practice. Whether you're learning the basics or working on small projects, this is the perfect place to start.

## 🚀 What's Inside?

This repository features a curated selection of beginner-friendly Python projects, designed to help new programmers grasp fundamental concepts through practical examples. The projects range from simple number games and calculators to more complex logic-based applications, each showcasing important Python features such as conditionals, loops, functions, and string manipulation. Each project is available both as source code and executable `.exe` files, allowing you to either run them directly or explore the inner workings of the code.

## 🌟 Application Descriptions

12. **Date Difference Calculator 📅**  
    Calculates the difference between two dates in terms of years, months, and days. Also displays the total days and months elapsed.

13. **Snake Game 🐍**  
    A classic arcade game where players control a snake to collect food and grow. The game features adjustable difficulty levels and scoring.

14. **Hangman Game 💀**  
    A graphical hangman game where players guess letters to reveal a hidden word. Includes randomized words and a visual representation of incorrect guesses.

15. **Clock Date App 🕰**  
    A digital clock application that displays the current time and date, with support for light and dark modes. The design adapts dynamically to user preferences.

16. **Course Schedule 📚**  
    A course management tool for students to add, edit, delete, and view their course schedules. It organizes information such as course name, instructor, day, and time.

17. **ATM App 🏦**  
    A banking simulation where users can deposit, withdraw, and check balances. Features include transaction history and account tracking.

18. **City Country Quiz 🌍**  
    A geography trivia game challenging players to match cities with their corresponding countries. Includes multiple-choice options and scoring.

19. **Caesar Cipher 🔏**  
    Encrypt and decrypt text using the Caesar cipher method. Users can set a shift value and copy results to the clipboard.
