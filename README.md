Welcome to the **Simple Python Applications** repository! 🎉 This repository is designed for Python beginners looking to improve their programming skills through practical examples and hands-on practice. Whether you're learning the basics or working on small projects, this is the perfect place to start.

## 🚀 What's Inside?

This repository features a curated selection of beginner-friendly Python projects, designed to help new programmers grasp fundamental concepts through practical examples. The projects range from simple number games and calculators to more complex logic-based applications, each showcasing important Python features such as conditionals, loops, functions, and string manipulation. Each project is available both as source code and executable `.exe` files, allowing you to either run them directly or explore the inner workings of the code.

## 🌟 Application Descriptions

1. **Calculator** 🧮  
   A scientific calculator built with Tkinter, offering not only basic arithmetic operations (addition, subtraction, multiplication, division) but also advanced functions like exponentiation, square roots, logarithms, constants like π, and full trigonometric support including sine, cosine, tangent, and cotangent. It features a clear, button-based interface and keyboard support.

2. **Odd Even Checker** 🔢  
   A fast-paced guessing game with 10 rounds. The player is shown a random number and must guess whether it's odd or even. Scores are updated live (+10 for correct, -5 for incorrect). A win or loss screen appears after the final attempt. Includes a restart option and clean score tracking.

3. **Fibonacci Game** 🐑  
   Players are shown a range between two Fibonacci numbers and must enter five numbers in correct ascending order. The app validates the sequence, offers success/failure feedback, and allows range regeneration or replay. It's a great way to intuitively engage with number patterns.

4. **Prime Number Game** 🔍  
   A timed 10-round quiz game. In each round, five numbers are displayed and the user must select the prime one. The app evaluates input, provides real-time feedback, tracks score and rounds, and displays final performance with replay and exit options.

5. **Rock Paper Scissors** ✊✋✌  
   A best-of-10 match between player and computer. After each round, the app visually indicates the result (✓, ✗, or - for draw), updates scores, and announces the winner when 10 points are reached. Includes a replay system, modern UI, and vibrant color cues.

6. **Password Generator** 🔐  
   A secure password generator offering 8 or 12-character options. Generated passwords include uppercase, lowercase, numbers, and special characters, and always start with a non-zero digit. Clipboard copy is one-click. UI changes based on selection with visual feedback.

7. **Word Counter** 📝  
   A text analysis tool for writing tasks or file reviews. It counts words, letters, spaces, and sentences. Supports live typing or file upload (`.txt` and `.docx`), real-time feedback, reset option, and dark mode styling for easier reading.

8. **Number Guessing Game** 🎯  
   A guessing game with difficulty settings (Easy/Medium/Hard), each adjusting range and attempts. Players receive hint feedback ("Too low" or "Too high") after each guess, and results are shown when the correct number is guessed or attempts run out.

9. **Todo List** ✅  
   A fully interactive task manager. Tasks can include start/end dates, reminders (including recurring and weekly), and category assignment. Features include task editing, marking complete, notifications via `plyer`, category management, and persistent display of completed items.

10. **Simple Agenda** 📅  
   A smart calendar with month/year navigation, date-specific event management, multi-day event tracking, and optional yearly recurrence. Visually highlights event days on the calendar and shows group events when clicked. Built-in JSON-based storage and status messages guide users.

11. **Palindrome Checker** 🔄  
   An interactive utility that detects palindromes in input text or uploaded files. It shows a count of palindrome words, supports listing them in a scrollable view, and works with `.txt` and `.docx` formats. Clean UI with file handling and state-aware buttons.

12. **Date Difference Calculator** 📅  
   Calculates exact differences between two user-entered dates, showing the breakdown in years, months, days, total days, and total months. Includes input validation, error messaging, and reset functionality—all within a clean visual layout.

13. **Snake Game** 🐍  
   Classic arcade-style Snake game with Easy, Medium, and Hard modes (each with target scores). The snake moves within a grid, grows upon eating food, and ends the game on wall or self-collision. Real-time score display, restart, and back-to-menu options are included.

14. **Hangman Game** 💀  
   ASCII-art based hangman game with dynamic word selection (from file or defaults). Tracks attempts, shows guessed letters, updates visuals, and provides win/lose messages. Replay supported with input validation and feedback throughout.

15. **Clock Date App** 🕰  
   A digital time and date display with real-time updates every second. Automatically detects local timezone using `tzlocal`, and includes a toggleable dark/light theme with intuitive UI and dynamic styling.

16. **Course Schedule** 📚  
   A semester planner that allows students to input and manage course details including name, code, instructor, room, day, and time. Features add/edit/delete functions, dropdowns for day/time selection, validation, and a table view sorted by schedule.

17. **ATM App** 🏦  
   A simulation app mimicking ATM behavior. Users can input a starting balance, deposit or withdraw money, and view a running transaction history. GUI flows between screens, and errors like overdrawing are gracefully handled.

18. **City Country Quiz** 🌍  
   A 10-question multiple-choice quiz. A city is shown and the user must select the correct country. Feedback is instant, and the final score is shown at the end. Data sourced from a city-country text file for variety and challenge.

19. **Caesar Cipher** 🔏  
   Text encryption and decryption using the Caesar cipher method. Users select the shift value and operation (encode/decode). The result is shown and can be copied to clipboard. Includes feedback for invalid input and visual status indicators.

### 🔢️ Download & Run
